# Rough notes 

- Installing 3 on macOS
- Installing Python 3 on macOS
- https://flaviocopes.com/python-installation-macos/
- 
- macOS installs Python 2 (outdated) by default, 
- for compatibility reasons, 
- making it available as /usr/bin/python.
- 
- If you install Xcode, the Apple Development IDE, it installs Python 3 in /usr/bin/python3. 
- In this case you can run python3 on your terminal to check the exact version installed, and if it’s recent - enough you might be already set up.
- 
- Python 3 is the one we’re going to use for modern Python development.
- One option is to use Homebrew to install the latest Python release.
- When it’s finally installed, Python is installed as /usr/bin/python3
- 
- However you have little control over the version number you run, as Apple updates it only with new Xcode - releases.
